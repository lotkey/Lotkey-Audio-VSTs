Lotkey Audio homemade VSTs and VST3s

### FUBAR:
Hard-clip audio

### Wavesplitter:
Splits each full wave in the audio buffer into a number of waves set by the user

### Pseudomin:  
Oscillator controlled by frequency and amplitude of incoming audio. Originally intended to be used as a pseudo-theremin.

### AudioToMIDI (demo):  
Converts incoming audio to outgoing MIDI. This outgoing MIDI uses the pitch wheel to correctly bend to the right microtone. The pitch wheel only seems to correctly work with ReaSynth. This is a work in progress!
