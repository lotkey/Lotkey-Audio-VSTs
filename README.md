### FUBAR:
Hard-clip audio

### Wavesplitter:
Splits each full wave in the audio buffer into a number of waves set by the user

### Pseudomin:  
Converts incoming audio to a pure sine wave of the same frequency. This plugin was used to mimic a theremin. The original intention was to play a guitar with a slide and feed that audio into this plugin to be able to humanize the vibrato.

### AudioToMIDI (demo):  
Converts incoming audio to outgoing MIDI. This outgoing MIDI uses the pitch wheel to correctly bend to the right microtone. The pitch wheel only seems to correctly work with ReaSynth. This is a work in progress!
